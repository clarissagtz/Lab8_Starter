1.  Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
 
 Ans: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because running tests manually takes a lot of time and could also contribute to human error. Furthermore, running all tests after development is complete requires multiple testing procedures to occur at one time, meaning we cannot see how specific features work.

 2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no) 
 
 Ans. No.
